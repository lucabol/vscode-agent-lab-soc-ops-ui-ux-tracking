### Minor UI/UX Improvements (from UI Review)

1. **Header Font Size**
   - Increase the font size of headers (e.g., "SOC OPS") for better visibility, especially on mobile.

2. **Button and Tap Target Sizing**
   - Review and increase the size of header buttons (e.g., "← Reset") for easier tapping on mobile.

3. **Grid Gap Tweaks**
   - Consider increasing the gap between Bingo squares on larger screens for improved visual separation.

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Add subtle visual feedback (e.g., ripple or highlight) on Bingo and Scavenger buttons for better touch interaction.

5. **Progress Bar Polish**
   - Enhance the appearance of the Scavenger Hunt progress bar (e.g., add animation or color transitions).

6. **Consistent Padding**
   - Audit and standardize padding/margin across all screens for a more unified look.

These are not critical, but would further polish the app's look and feel.
